In Chapter [-@sec:theory], the most succesful testable theory to date
describing succesfully the properties and dynamics of our universe at the most fundamental scales has been reviewed.
Nevertheless, clear limitations of the Standard Model as it is currently
formulated are known,
such as the complete omission of gravity forces or the absence of viable
dark matter candidates, motivating the quest for alternative
unified descriptions of the physical world. A direct
path to verify the predictions of the Standard Model up to high acurracy
and test alternative theoretical models is to collide high energy particles
in a controlled setting and quantitatively study the properties scattering
particles produced. That is the aim of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the
experiments set up around its collision points. In this chapter, the main
design characteristics of a general purpose high-energy physics experiment,
namely the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the LHC, will be explored.
Given the data-centric nature of the next chapters, particular significance
will be given to the acquisition, processing and simulation of individual
experimental observations, commonly referred to as events.


## The LHC accelerator complex

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the largest and most poweful particle
accelerator on operation at the time of writing. Its main purpose is to
accelerate bunches of protons and other heavier nuclei in opposite
directions to ultra-relativistic velocities, so then can be collimated
and made interact at high-energies around several specified collision
points inside specially design detector.
The LHC machine complex is located at the European
Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) laboratories around
the Switzerland-France border near Geneva, its most distinctive element being
a ring of superconductive magnets and accelerating structures
installed along 26.7 km circular underground tunnel. The setup was designed
to achieve center-of-mass energies up to 14 TeV for nominal instantaneous
luminosities reaching $10 \times 10^{34} \textrm{cm}^{-1} \textrm{s}^{-1}$
for proton-proton collisions.
