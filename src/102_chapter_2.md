In Chapter [-@sec:theory], the most succesful testable theory to date
describing succesfully the properties and dynamics of our universe at the most fundamental scales has been reviewed.
Nevertheless, clear limitations of the Standard Model as it is currently
formulated are known,
such as the complete omission of gravity forces or the absence of viable
dark matter candidates, motivating the quest for alternative
unified descriptions of the physical world. A direct
path to verify the predictions of the Standard Model up to high acurracy
and test alternative theoretical models is to collide high energy particles
in a controlled setting and quantitatively study the properties scattering
particles produced. That is the aim of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the
experiments set up around its collision points. In this chapter, the main
design characteristics of a general purpose high-energy physics experiment,
namely the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the LHC, will be explored.
Given the data-centric nature of the next chapters, particular significance
will be given to the acquisition, processing and modelling of individual
experimental observations, commonly referred to as events.
