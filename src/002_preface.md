# Preface {.unnumbered}

This document is a summary of the main projects that I have
carried out within my PhD in Physics at the University of Padua (UNIPD),
between December 2015 and the December 2018. The main
research focus, connecting the projects
presented here, has been the development and application
of new statistical learning techniques in particle collider
experiments. Given the interdisciplinary nature of the topics
discussed in this thesis, an effort has been made to discuss
the research issues and solutions in a domain generic manner,
so the links with the fields of statistic and machine learning
are more evident.
The price of such attempt has likely been a less cohesive
narrative, yet I believe that is has been worth the cost
for a different take on the data analysis problems
at particle colliders.

Most of the work included in this report has been carried
out while employed by the INFN - Sezione di Padova as an
Early Stage Researcher of the AMVA4NewPhysics MSCA-ITN.
AMVA4NewPhysics is a European research network (EU Horizon 
2020 Grant
Agreement 675440) that provided the funding and
context for the ventures described in this document.
Part of the results presented here were joint work
with other collaborators at CMS experiment
at LHC, which is based at the European Organisation for
Nuclear Research (CERN).
