Machine learning is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the
general problem of how
computers can automatically improve at certain tasks given data. The usefulness
and range of applicability of such techniques has surged in the last
decades due to the increase on accessible computational power and
the amount of useful data available. In this section, a general overview of
machine learning methods as well as the main tasks that can addressed with them
will be provided. Subsequently, the technical basis of two specific types of
tools used in the next chapters will be explored: boosted
decision trees and neural networks. Last but not least, we will go through
a brief review of the common past use cases of these techniques at high energy
physics experiments, especially focussing on those cases where they can
be used to address some of the statistical issues from
Chapter [-@sec:statinf].
