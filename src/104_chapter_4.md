Machine learning is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the
general problem of how
computers can automatically improve at certain tasks given data. The usefulness
and range of applicability of such techniques has surged in the last
decades due to the increase on accessible computational power and
the extend of useful data available. In this section, a general overview of
machine learning methods and the main tasks that can addressed with them
will be provided. Subsequently, the technical basis of two specific types of
tools that will be used in the next chapter will be explored: boosted
decision trees and neural networks. Last but not least, we will go through
a brief review of the common past use cases of these techniques at high energy
physics experiments to address some of the statistical issues from
Chapter [-@sec:statinf].
