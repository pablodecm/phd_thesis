Machine learning is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the
general problem of how
computers can automatically improve at certain tasks given data. The usefulness
and range of applicability of such techniques has surged in the last
decades due to the increase on accessible computational power and
the amount of useful data available. In this section, a general overview of
machine learning methods as well as the main tasks that can addressed with them
will be provided. Subsequently, the technical basis of two specific types of
tools used in the next chapters will be explored: boosted
decision trees and neural networks. Last but not least, we will go through
a brief review of the common past use cases of these techniques at high energy
physics experiments, especially focussing on those cases where they can
be used to address some of the statistical issues from
Chapter [-@sec:statinf].

## Problem Description

Machine learning is the field that deals with
algorithms, as described by computer programs,
that are able to *learn* from data. A more formal definition of learning,
yet general and useful in the context of this work, can be found
in the literature [@Mitchell:1997:ML:541177]: "A computer program is said
to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$
and performance measure $P$, if its performance at task in $T$, as
measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$". The previous sentence
clearly denotes the three key elements for learning in the context
of computer algorithms: the task (or class of task) that to be accomplished
$T$, a quantitative and robust way to measure the performance on those
tasks $P$ and a set of data that the algorithm can experience in order
to improve $E$.

The first step in order to tackle a problem with machine learning
techniques is the formal definition of the task $T$, together with
a quantifiable metric that scores the accuracy on such
task $P$. In this section, an overview of the most common machine learning
tasks that are of relevance for their possible use in particle
collider experiments and similar scientific contexts.
