# Modelling and Inference at the LHC {#sec:statinf}

In this chapter, the problem of extracting quantitative
information about the validity or properties of the different
theoretical models (see Chapter [-@sec:theory]) can be made given the
data experimental data acquired in a controlled setting (see Chapter
[-@sec:experiment]) will be tackled. We will begin by formally defining
common inference problems in experimental high-energy physics and how they
can be tackled with classical techniques.
Then some relevant particularities of the inference problems
at the LHC experiments will be discussed, mainly the
generative-only nature of the simulation models and the high dimensionality
of the data. As we will see, both issues are intimately related, the former
requiring the use of likelihood-free inference techniques such as constructing
a non-parametric sample likelihoods, which in turn demands for lower
dimensional summary statistics.
