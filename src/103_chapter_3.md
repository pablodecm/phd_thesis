# Statistical Inference and Modelling at the LHC {#sec:statinf}

In this chapter, the problem of extracting quantitative
information about the validity or properties of the different
theoretical models (see Chapter [-@sec:theory]) can be made given the
data experimental data acquired in a controlled setting (see Chapter
[-@sec:experiment]) will be tackled. We will begin by formally defining
common inference problems in experimental high-energy physics and how they
can be tackled with classical techniques.
Then some relevant particularities of the inference problems
at the LHC experiments will be discussed, mainly the
generative-only nature of the simulation models and the high dimensionality
of the data. As we will see, both issues are intimately related, the former
requiring the use of likelihood-free inference techniques such as constructing
a non-parametric sample likelihoods, which in turn demands for lower
dimensional summary statistics.


## Problem Definition

Let us suppose that we record a collection of detector readouts
$D = \{\boldsymbol{x}_0,...,\boldsymbol{x}_n\}$ for a total $n$ bunch crossings
at a particle collider experiment, such as CMS at the LHC (see Section
[-@sec:cms]). Note that vector notation is used for each individual readout,
also referred to as event, because for mathematical simplification
we will be assuming that each detector observation can be embedded
as a member of a fixed size
$d$-dimensional space, i.e. $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathcal{X}
\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, even though variable-size sets or tree-like
structures might be a more compact and useful representation in practise,
as will be discussed later.
As an starting point,
let us assume that the detector readout for every bunch crossing
is recorded, i.e. no trigger filtering system as the one described in
[Section @sec:trigger] is in place, hence after each bunch crossing $i$ a
given raw detector readout $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ will be obtained.
