\epigraph{An approximate answer to the right question
is worth a great deal more than a precise answer
to the wrong question.}{John Tukey}

By this point, it should have been made evident that powerful
statistical inference is the ultimate objective of all
experimental high-energy analyses. Supervised learning
based on simulated observation or acquired data control
regions, and in particular probabilistic classification,
provides a way to approximate latent variables
that are very useful as summaries for inference.
