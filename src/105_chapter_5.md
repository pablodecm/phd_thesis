In this chapter, the concepts and techniques from the previous sections are
applied in the search for non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs,
using data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV
collected in 2016 by the CMS detector at the LHC, 
corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of $35.9\ \textrm{fb}^{-1}$.
The most probably decay channel for the Higgs boson pairs, where
each Higgs boson leads to a a $\textrm{b}\bar{\textrm{b}}$, is considered.
While the aforementioned final state is the most frequent by a considerably
margin, a large background of similar events is expected from
multijet QCD processes, which motivates the use of machine learning techniques
to construct a summary statistic that can exploit the fine differences
between signal and background for statistical inference. In fact, the
expected background is so copious that insufficient simulated observations can
be generated to obtain the required level of modelling accuracy, thus
we have to resort to the development of a new data-driven background estimation
technique referred to as hemisphere mixing [@DeCastroManzano:2017yqy].
In addition to setting upper limits of the standard model (SM) production
of Higgs boson pairs,
the data analysis framework is also used to set upper limits in
the context of effective field (EFT) theories of anomalous
couplings, that parametrise possible deviations from the SM. The
main results presented in this section, have been carry out within
the CMS Collaboration, and have been published and made public [@Sirunyan:2018tki].
