Humans strive for understanding the world by seeking explanations
to the varied natural phenomena happening around us,
and accumulating the resulting knowledge in models that
can be used to predict and shape the future reality.
The scientific method provides a formal framework for carrying out these
investigations and checking the validity of the current description of
our environment. Recorded experience of assumed known origin,
also known as data, has a central role in updating these explicative
theories, because it can provide quantitative or qualitative
support of some candidate explanations over others.

However, direct sensory perception and personal information processing has a
limited investigative reach and it is easily affected by subjective
conditions. Well understood and calibrated instruments of
measurement can be used instead for data acquisition, in controlled
settings referred as scientific experiments, so that
quantifiability and precision are enhanced. The same
applies to theoretical modelling and experimental data analysis, where robust
mathematical and computational procedures empower more accurate
descriptions of the world we live in. These establish a
strong coupling between technology and science, by which technical
and conceptual innovations allow the development of better tools,
which in term lead to more scientific knowledge.

The universe is filled with an abundance of
interesting situations occurring at very
different time and space scales, so curious observers might
face a difficult choice when deciding what to focus their scientific
attention. Nevertheless, there seems to be a complexity hierarchy
whereby larger physical systems are composed by simpler parts, and
their properties can be explained by means of their
constituents interactions. Hence, a worthy path of exploration can
start with the study of the most fundamental components of nature and
their dynamics.  At our current level of understanding,
we can reason this would be a quest motivated solely by curiosity, pushed
by our desire of making sense of the structure of reality, and not
a pragmatic proxy for the development of technological applications.
That will be our motivation to delve into experimental particle
physics, a discipline dealing with the practical study of the
most elementary constituents of matter and its interactions.

It is important to remark that the elementary quality of the chosen subject
of study does not
imply that the journey towards valuable scientific knowledge in this area
area will be a simple one. On the contrary, as it will be made evident
by the following chapters, this undertaking poses grand technical
and non-technical challenges which in many cases require novel solutions.
Furthermore, the problems at hand are often closely related with those
present in other research or technological fields, so their findings
and innovations can be repurposed. Oftentimes this can even be a
bidirectional relation, where the obstacles are challenging or
original enough that solutions have to go beyond the state of
the art in the relevant domain. In general, the pursuance of fundamental
explanations does require solutions for multitude of applied problems.

Hence, advances and expertise from other disciplines can accelerate
significantly the rate of progress in this fundamental research domain.
This is specially
relevant in areas where the infrastructure changes required are low
such as data analysis. Yet, some
barriers exist against the proliferation of interdisciplinarity, such as field
specific language (also known as scientific jargon) and seemingly unclear
problem descriptions for collaborators with different backgrounds.
This document, in addition of presenting the main research
results of the projects I have been involved during the last years
as a graduate student,
will attempt to reduce this communication gap by trying to clearly
state the main
data analysis challenges we face in experimental particle physics in a way
they can be linked to other data-centric disciplines such as statistics
and machine learning.

The general methodology considered in this work consists on breaking the
main research goal in a series of applied problems, express them in a
domain-generic way and understand what is their role in view of the
final aim. When possible, the concepts and methods presented will be
illustrated with simple examples which can be a
great help to understand their main principles.
The mentioned perspective shift combined with the use of practical but
minimal examples has been really useful to identify possible shortcomings
on the way data analysis is carried out at the LHC and develop new techniques
capable of addressing them. However, I am of the opinion the
projects mentioned and presented in this document are not but a first step
of what is possible; and the betterment of data analysis techniques
and tools could be a promising route for the advancement of our understanding
of basic building blocks of the universe.
