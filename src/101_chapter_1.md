Humans strive for understanding the world by seeking explanations
to the varied natural phenomena happening around us,
and accumulating the resulting knowledge in models that
can be used to predict and shape the future reality.
The scientific method provides a formal framework for carrying out these
investigations and checking the validity of the current description of
our environment. Recorded experience of assumed known origin,
also known as data, has a central role in updating these explicative
theories, because it can provide quantitative or qualitative
support of some candidate explanations over others.

However, personal sensory perception and information processing has a
limited investigative reach and it is easily affected by subjective
conditions. Well understood and calibrated instruments of
measurement can be used instead for data acquisition, in controlled
settings referred as scientific experiments, so that
quantifiability and precision are enhanced. The same
applies to model building and experimental data analysis, where robust
mathematical and computational procedures empower more accurate
descriptions of the world we live in. These establish a
strong coupling technology and science, by which technical and conceptual
innovations allow the development of better tools, which in term lead
to more scientific knowledge.

The universe is filled with an abundance of
interesting situations occurring at very
different time and space scales, so curious observers might
face a difficult choice when deciding what to focus their scientific
attention. Nevertheless, there seems to be a complexity hierarchy
whereby larger physical systems are composed by simpler parts, and
their properties can be explained by means of their
constituents interactions. Hence, a worthy path of exploration can
start with the study of the most fundamental components of nature and
their dynamics. At our current level of understanding,
we can reason this would be a quest motivated solely by curiosity, pushed
by our desire of making sense of the structure of reality, and not
a pragmatic proxy for the development of new technologies.

It is important to remark that the elementary quality of the chosen subject
of study does not
imply that the journey towards valuable scientific knowledge in this area
area will be a simple one. On the contrary, as it will be made evident
by the following chapters, this undertaking poses grand technical
and non-technical challenges which in many cases require novel solutions.
Furthermore, the problems at hand are often closely related with those
present in other research or technological fields, so findings
and innovations can be repurposed.
