Scientific theories are frameworks describing natural phenomena that are
capable of making experimentally testable predictions. Oftentimes, they are
specified using mathematical language and built on previous observational
knowledge and basic properties of the system under study. 
At the most fundamental scales known to date,
the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a scientific theory that
provides a very accurate description of most of the observed properties
and dynamics of the universe around us. It is constructed upon an innovative
theoretical framework, generally referred as quantum field theory (QFT),
and principles regarding basic symmetries.
In this chapter, a non-exhaustive introduction to this theory and its
descriptive reach will be provided together with a summary of the known
limitations and possible extensions or alternatives.
