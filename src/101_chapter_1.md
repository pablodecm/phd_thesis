Scientific theories are frameworks describing natural phenomena that are
capable of making experimentally testable predictions. Oftentimes, they are
specified using mathematical language and built on previous observational
knowledge and basic properties of the system under study. 
At the most fundamental scales known to date,
the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a scientific theory that
provides a very accurate description of most of the observed properties
and dynamics of the universe around us. It is constructed upon an innovative
theoretical framework, generally referred as quantum field theory (QFT),
and principles regarding basic symmetries.
In this chapter, a non-exhaustive introduction to this theory and its
descriptive reach will be provided together with a summary of the known
limitations and possible extensions or alternatives.
Given the experimental character of the research discussed in the following
chapters, the aim of this chapter is not solely the discussion of the
fundamental structure and properties of the theory, but also
the methodology followed to compute predictions for observables
that can be contrasted with empirical data.

## The Standard Model

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a mathematically
self-consistent gauge field
theory that classifies all known types of elementary particles and 
describes their electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions.
Within this fundamental theory, all known matter and energy phenomena
can be explained in terms of the kinematics and interactions
of elementary particles, which can in turn be understood as
local excitations of different fields that permeate our universe.

From a historical perspective, this theory is the product of
a succession of important theoretical developments and experimental
discoveries over the last century [@weinberg2004making],
culminating
with the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 [@higgs2012cms;@higgs2012atlas].
If a more principled viewpoint is taken, the SM can be thought
as the most general but mathematically consistent
theory that respects a set of symmetries, namely
a global Poincaré group symmetry (translational, rotational
and relativistic
boost invariance) and a local
$$G_\textrm{SM} = SU(3)_{C}\otimes SU(2)_{L} \otimes U(1)_{Y}$$ {#eq:sm_gauge_symmetry}
gauge group symmetry. The
$G_\textrm{SM}$ symmetry group is essential to describe three of the four
fundamental interactions observed in nature: strong interaction,
weak interaction and electromagnetic interaction. In fact, the
$SU(3)_{C}$ is associated the strong force and the conservation of
color while the $SU(2)_{L} \otimes U(1)_{Y}$ is
retated with electroweak interactions (unification of weak and
electromagnetic) and the conservation of isospin and
hypercharge.

The SM is typically specified using the Lagrangian formalism and depends
on a total of 19 parameters, which are not predicted by the theory
but determined through experimental measurements.

In the context of the SM, excitations of the fundamental fields
give rise to two types of elementary particles: fermions (characterised
by having half-integer spin) and bosons (characterised by having
integer spin). Fermions are the fundamental constituents of matter
are further subdivided into leptons and quarks depending on their 
interactions. A schematic overview of the fundamental particles
of the SM and their properties is provided in
[@Fig:standard_model_particles].


## Beyond the Standard Model

## Phenenomenology of proton collisions

Once the properties and limitations of the theoretical model that best
describes the current understanding of the fundamental structure and
dynamics of nature have been described,
we can delve into how we can model proton-proton
collisions from a practical perspective, so theoretical predictions
can be contrasted with experimental results at the LHC. The focus
of section is to make sense of the products of high-energy
proton-proton collisions and how we can predict their relative
rates (frequencies of ocurring) given some initial state
conditions for the interaction.
