\epigraph{Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end.}{Seneca}

Humans strive for understanding the world by seeking explanations
to the varied natural phenomena happening around us,
and accumulating the resulting knowledge in models that
can be used to predict and shape the future reality.
The scientific method provides a formal framework for carrying out these
investigations and checking the validity of the current description of
our environment. Recorded experience of well-known or controlled origin,
also known as data, has a central role in updating these explicative
theories, because it can provide quantitative or qualitative
support of some candidate explanations over others.
