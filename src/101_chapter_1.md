Humans strive for understanding the world by seeking explanations
to the varied natural phenomena happening around us,
and accumulating the resulting knowledge in models that
can be used to predict and shape the future reality.
The scientific method provides a formal framework for carrying out these
investigations and checking the validity of the current description of
our environment. Recorded experience of well-known or controlled origin,
also known as data, has a central role in updating these explicative
theories, because it can provide quantitative or qualitative
support of some candidate explanations over others.

However, personal sensory perception and information processing has a
limited investigative reach and it is easily subjected to subjective
conditioning. Well understood and calibrated instruments of
measurement can be used instead for data acquisition, in controlled
settings referred as scientific experiments. The same
applies to model building and experimental data analysis, where robust
mathematical and computational procedures empower more accurate
descriptions of the world we live in.

The universe is filled with interesting situations occurring at very
different time and space scales, so curious observers might
face a difficult choice when deciding what to focus their scientific
attention. Nevertheless, there seems to be a complexity hierarchy
whereby larger physical systems are composed by simpler parts, and
their dynamics and properties can be explained by means of their
constituents interactions.
